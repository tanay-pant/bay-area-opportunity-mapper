# bay-area-opportunity-mapper

An interactive map build in GeoPandas and Folium of the best places in the Bay Area to live in based on certain criteria. Data based on: x, y, z.

This is an early demo. Some next steps would involve using real-time web scraping from websites like LinkedIn, Zillow, etc. for accurate data rather than relying on static CSV file data.
