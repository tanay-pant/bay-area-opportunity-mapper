An interactive heatmap built with GeoPandas and Folium to help explore promising Bay Area ZIP codes based on rent, crime, transit access, and income.

This is an early demo (2-week project of mine). Next steps could include using live APIs (Zillow/Transit/Jobs) for present-day accurate data rather than relying on static CSV files supplied by the government. Additionally, improving data pipelines, adding richer streamlit interactivity, getting a dataset of crime by ZIP CODE as opposed to County, and introducing more metrics would help make the model more comprehensive.
